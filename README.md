# Vue 3 + Tailwind 3 + Vue CLI

## Description

Generated with `@vue/cli@next` which support PostCSS 8 (which is required by Tailwind 3).

No Vite required! ðŸ¥³
You can keep using the Vue CLI you know!

> Note: This repo includes Tauri for running the project as a desktop app. It's probably unnecessary for you.

## Making the same from scratch

Just uninstall your global `@vue/cli` and run `npm install -g @vue/cli@next` to install the beta version.
Then generate a **Vue 3** project as you like.
Then follow the [Tailwind 3 installation guide using PostCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss). Don't forget to include your `*.vue` files in `tailwind.config.js`.

> The Tauri Vue CLI plugin can be added following its [instructions](https://github.com/tauri-apps/vue-cli-plugin-tauri) without any problem.
